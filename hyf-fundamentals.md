## Suggested plan: ##

Print out the checklist above. For the javaScript fundamentals, we suggest to do the following: 

Step 1. Learn concept fundamentally. Make sure you really understand the concept. 

- How it works 
- What it does exactly, and how it can be used.  
- When to use it, when not to use it. 
-Try to explain the concept clearly to another person. (Make sure you actually try this) 

Sugggested resources :
javascript.info    

Step 2. Apply concept

You don’t fully understand a concept unless you can apply it in a context. 
Write code that uses the concept in various ways and make sure you use it in the way it is intended. (And run it to make sure it works) 

Suggestions:

Codewars.com Alghoritmic challenges, based per subject. Search per subject on the website. (Don’t do kata’s lower than 6) 
Freecodecamp.com challenges and explanation per concept 
Building your own application, in which you start to apply the above concepts


Step 3. 
Re-read your homework, and see how the concepts are applied in the homework assignment related to the subject. Re-write (part of) the code again to make sure you master it 


Step 4.

Check the box of the checklist. Move on to next subject.
