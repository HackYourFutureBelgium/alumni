## Questions at interviews ##

This document shows what questions you can expect at an interview, depending on the type of role you are applying for. (front/back-end/full-stack)


There are 2 goals for practicing these questions:

1. Check if you understand the most important concepts related to the job you are applying for
2. Check if you can verbalise the answers in a correct way. (understanding something is not the same as being able to explain it well to someone else)

We strongly recommend going over these questions multiple times, and having fellow students ask you these questions to prepare well for an interview. Answering a question in your head, is NOT the same as doing in front of a real person. Many people get in trouble in interviews because they don’t practice answering questions in front of other people. 

Each question has a link to a correct answer, but make sure you understand the answer well, and can give concrete examples for each question.
