Register at codewars.com. 

Codewars is a website where you can train your coding skills by solving coding puzzles (kata’s). This is a very good way to improve your skills by actually coding. For each puzzle(kata) that you solve you will gain points. You will start at level 8, and after solving puzzles, your level will become lower, until maximum level 1 which is the highest possible rank. (only for elite coders)

You will start doing level 8 kata’s, which are easier, and as you feel comfortable, you will try to solve harder kata’s with lower values. After you finish an assignment, you can see how other people have solved the same challenge. This is a great way to learn from other developers, and understand how they use clever ways to solve the same problem. You will notice that you will struggle solving problems at the beginning, but that you get better at it quickly once you have solved some exercises. 

Your goal is to gain as many possible points on codewars, and practicing this as a part of your daily routine so that you write code every day. 

Goal:

- Code every day at codewars
- Gain as many points as possible
