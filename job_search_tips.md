## How to find a job or internship yourself ##

After graduating from HackYourFuture, there are two ways to find employment:

Option 1) HYF will introduce you to companies for employment opportunities. 
We have a network of over 50 companies that are looking for IT talent. Depending on their needs and your profile, we will connect you to a relevant company.

Option 2) You find employment yourself.
There is a higher chance to find employment quickly if you start searching for opportunities yourself as well. 
This document contains some resources and tips to help you find internships and jobs (option 2).

**What do we mean by employment?**

We make a distinction between a job and internship. What is the difference? An internship is a short-term agreement (usually 3-6 months) in which you work for a company. As most HYF graduates are on welfare (uitkering), a company will not pay you for the internship, since this will be deducted from your welfare in most municipalities. Jobs are usually 6 or 12-month contracts with a salary. 

Most graduates will start with an internship as most companies want to get to know you better first, before offering you a job. However, many internships result in a job offer. There are many examples of HYF students who started with an internship and were then offered a contract by the same company.

Employment can be both full- and part-time. To find a full-time internship or job is usually easier.

**Will I get paid?**

Most of HYF graduates are on welfare (‘uitkering’). As such, any remuneration for an internship will be deducted from your welfare. Therefore, companies will usually not pay any remuneration. That’s not a bad thing, as most internships have a good chance leading to a contract offer (job). Once you are offered a job, you will receive a salary and no longer welfare. The salary depends on the company.

**What is in it for HackYourFuture?**

HackYourFuture is a not-for-profit foundation. This means that we rely on sponsorship by partners as well as fees by companies. This is the only way we can train the next generation of developers with a refugee background. 

If you start an internship we charge the company 350 euros per month (excluding VAT). 
If a company decides to give you a contract, we charge a single fee of 3000 euros (any internship fees will be deducted from this). This is still below the market fee for junior developers. Moreover, some of you are living in gemeentes/municipalities (e.g. Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Den haag) where an employer will receive financial compensation if they provide you with a job.

In case HackYourFuture connects you to a company (option 1) we will negotiate the fees. 

If you find an internship or job yourself (option 2) we understand negotiating a fee for HackYourFuture is a bit more complicated. It is best to convince a company of your qualities first, before mentioning any fee. Once you are invited for an interview you can mention the education fee. It is good to mention that HYF is a not-for-profit organization and that we use these revenues to train the next generation of developers. If they need more information about the fees (there is some room for negotiation) they can always contact me. Feel free to share my contact details with them: Wouter@hackyourfuture.net / 0611854455
